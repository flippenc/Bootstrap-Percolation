ConjectureCheckingUtilies:

All file names are input without file extensions. So conjectures/someFile.txt will be input as 'conjectures/someFile'
This naming convention makes generating new file names easier
Results from conjecture checking functions are saved to multiple txt files to make certain other functions run more easily,
especially those that pull g6 strings from files. Trying to get those strings with regex would be annoying because they 
almost always contain special characters which can mess up regex parsing

checkFalseConjList(conj, suffix, sufficient=True)
	function for checking if a conjecture conj is present in the false conjecture list for the property 'suffix'
	i.e. if suffix is is_2_bootstrap_good, this will check if conj is in the list of false 2BG conjectures

recordFalseConj(conj, falseGraph, suffix, sufficient=True)
	function for recording a conjecture as false into the regular and verbose files for the property 'suffix'
	i.e. if a conjecture about is_2_bootstrap_good is false, it will be written to the 2BG conjecture lists
	alongside the graph that proved it false

recordFalsifyingGraph(falseGraph, suffix, sufficient=True)
	function for recording a graph as being one that has proven a conjecture involving 'suffix' false
	i.e. if a conjecture about is_2_boostrap_good is false, the graph that proved that will be written
	to the 2BG falsifying graph list

checkConjListAgainstFile(conjList, graphFile, outputFileName)
	function for testing a list of conjectures against a list of graphs in a file
	results sent to outputFileName

checkConjListDefault(conjList, outputFileName)
	function for testing a list of conjectures against a list of graphs which will be generated randomly
	results sent to outputFileName

checkConjListAgainstGraphs(conjList, testAgainst, outputFileName)
	function for testing a list of conjectures against a list of graphs
	results sent to outputFileName

checkConjFileDefault(conjListFile)
	function for testing a file of conjectures against a list of graphs which will be generated randomly
	results will be saved to the appropriate files for each conjecture
	i.e. every sufficient 2BG conjecture will be saved to the sufficient 2BG files

checkConjFileAgainstFile(conjListFile, graphFile)
	function for testing a file of conjectures against a file of graphs
	results will be saved to the appropriate files for each conjecture
	i.e. every sufficient 2BG conjecture will be saved to the sufficient 2BG files

checkConjFileAgainstGraphs(conjListFile, testAgainst)
	function for testing a file of conjectures against a list of graphs
	results will be saved to the appropriate files for each conjecture
	i.e. every sufficient 2BG conjecture will be saved to the sufficient 2BG files

evaluateString(s)
	function for simplfying logical strings into 'True' or 'False' using string replacements

replaceNeg(s), replaceAND(s), replaceOR(s), replaceXOR(s), replaceImp(s), replaceConv(s)
	functions that represent the truth tables for negation, AND, OR, XOR, ->, and <-

checkSingleConj(conj, testAgainst):
	function for testing a single conjecture agianst a list of graphs
	results are returned as a tuple 
	first element is if the conjecture is true (assumed true if not proven false) or false
	second element is empty if conjecture false, else it stores the graph that disproved
	the conjecture

getSuffix(line, suff)
	function used for determining file suffixes when saving results

findMinFalsifyingGraphFile(conjList, falseGraphList)
	function for finding the smallest falsifying graph for a given conjecture
	conjList and falseGraphList are files holding false conjecture and their falsifying graphs
	for line N of conjList, line N of falseGraphList is the graph that disproved it
	this function tries to find a graph of order smaller than the original falsifying graph

makeConjTuplesList(conjList, falseGraphList)
	function for turning the pairs of lines from findMinFalsifyingGraphFile into tuples

makeCheckingGraphs()
	function used in the checking functions when a list of graphs is not given
	returns a list of graphs from graph_objects with order<20 as well as 100
	graphs generated randomly which have the blocks_property

checkFileAgainstSmallGraphs(conjListFile, maxOrder=8, graphCond='-c')
	function for checking a list of conjectures against every graph of order range(3,maxOrder+1)
	which satisfies graphCond where graphCond is a parameter for nauty_geng
	check 'Graph Generation - nauty_geng man.txt' for a list of parameters

checkAgainstSmallGraphs(conj, maxOrder=8, graphCond='-c')
	function for checking a conjecture against every graph of order range(3,maxOrder+1)
	which satisfies graphCond where graphCond is a parameter for nauty_geng
	check 'Graph Generation - nauty_geng man.txt' for a list of parameters

recordMinFalsifying(conj, falseGraphString)
	function which records the minimum order graph which falsifies conj

findMinFalsifyingGraph(conj, falseGraphString)
	function which tries to find a smaller falsifying graph for conj than
	the graph given by falseGraphString
