nauty_geng(options="", debug=False)
	Return a generator which creates graphs from nauty’s geng program
	INPUT:
	
	•options– string (default:""); 
		a string passed to geng as if it was run at a system command line.
	At a minimum, you must pass the number of vertices you desire.  
	Sage expects the graphs to be in nauty’s “graph6” format, do not set an option to change this default or results will be unpredictable.
	
	•debug– 
	boolean (default:False);  
	if True the first line of geng’s output to standard error is captured and the first call to the generator’s next() function will return this line as a string.
	A line leading with “>A” indicates a successful initiation of the program with some information on the arguments, while a line beginning with “>E” indicates an error with the 		input. The possible options, obtained as output of geng --help:

n		: the number of vertices
mine:maxe	: <int>:<int> a range for the number of edges
		  <int>:0 means '<int> or more' except in the case 0:0
res/mod 	: only generate subset res out of subsets 0..mod-1
-c		: only write connected graphs
-C		: only write biconnected graphs
-t		: only generate triangle-free graphs
-f		: only generate 4-cycle-free graphs
-b		: only generate bipartite graphs(-t, -f and -b can be used in any combination)
-m		: save memory at the expense of time (only makes a difference in the absence of -b, -t, -f and n <= 28).
-d<int>		: a lower bound for the minimum degree
-D<int>		: a upper bound for the maximum degree
-v		: display counts by number of edges
-l		: canonically label output graphs
-q		: suppress auxiliary output (except from -v)
